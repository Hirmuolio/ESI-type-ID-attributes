# ESI-type-ID-attributes
Script that retrieves all attributes of a thing from ESI API.

Meant to be used on NPC ships but it will work on almost any item that has type ID.

The info on dogma attributes is saved in a txt file in same folder where the script is located.

By default the attributes are retreived for TQ. To get SISI stats simply uncomment the line that says *"#Uncomment this to get SISI stats"*

Requires:
* Python 3
* Requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
